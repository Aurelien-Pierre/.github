I don't program because I enjoy it (I don't), I program because our lives are ruled by computers and I refuse to suffer machine's rules. Every piece of code I write is meant to solve a real-life problem outside of computers. I work **with** computers, not **for** computers. I'm not a technophile, and I'm very cautious with what people call "progress".

The best solutions are the simplest, the best tools are the simplest, the best life is the simplest. If simple tools can't accomodate your workflow, your workflow is to probably to blame. Technology that escapes our understanding is technology that controls us ; this is unacceptable. Programming **is** political.

Design is a task that starts on paper with a properly-defined use case for a properly-defined user. Coding happens last. Code editors should not be opened until the problem(s) and the solution(s) are all laid out on paper. If no use case, then no problem, then no solution, then to coding, then enjoy mojitos and sunsets on the beach.

A well-managed project is one that incurs less work as time goes by. If you find yourself with an increasing amount of work, question your management.
