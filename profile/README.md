I don't program because I enjoy it (I don't), I program because our lives our ruled by computers and I refuse to suffer machine's rules. Every piece of code I write is meant to solve a real-life problem outside of computers. I work **with** computers, not **for** computers. I'm not a technophile, and I'm very cautious with what people call "progress".

The best solutions are the simplest, the best tools are the simplest, the best life is the simplest. If simple tools can't accomodate your workflow, maybe your workflow is to blame.
